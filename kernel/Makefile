# NOTE!: do not try to add -On to CFLAGS with gcc4.x, which will optimize the
# memcpy function a lot to let the kernel not work, for fixing this problem,
# please refer to glibc and rewrite the memcpy in include/string.h, or just not
# use any -On options with gcc 4.x when compiling it. in fact, we only can not
# use -On with gcc4.x to compile fork.c, but after that you need to isolate the
# compling procedure of it, it's not good too. for playing with linux-0.11, we
# just have fun, have no much concerning about the performance.
